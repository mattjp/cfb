2021 regular season win total futures

## B1G East

It's all overs, now.

### Indiana
* Line: 7.5
* Prediction: Over
* Wins: Idaho, Western KY, MSU, Maryland, Rutgers, Minnesota, Purdue
* Loses: Iowa, Cincinnati, Penn St., OSU, Michigan
* Notes: I think that they’re going to win the games they’re supposed to win and lose the games they’re supposed to lose. Cincinnati, PSU, Michigan could be wins; Iowa could easily be a loss. They're going to be teetering between 7 and 8 wins, I think 8 is more likely than 7 as one of the five games I have labeled as a loss should flip to the win column.

### Maryland
* Line: 5.5
* Prediction: Over
* Wins: Howard, Illinois, Kent State, Minnesota, Rutgers, MSU
* Loses: WVU, Iowa, OSU, Indiana, PSU, Michigan
* Notes: I think they’re going to have exactly 6 wins, but it’s more likely that they’ll have 5 wins than 7. Minnesota could easily be a loss, and WVU could be a win. I think that MSU will be a toss-up.

### Michigan
* Line: 7.5
* Prediction: Over
* Wins: Western Michigan, Northern Illinois, Rutgers, Nebraska, Northwestern, Michigan State, Indiana, Maryland
* Loses: Washington, Wisconsin, PSU, OSU
* Notes: 8 wins feels like the right number for Michigan this year. MSU always could be a loss, especially since the game is in East Lansing. If Indiana is performing well, it could be another loss. Washington is a major toss-up. Wisconsin and PSU could always flip to wins, but both games are on the road and we all know how Michigan performs against good teams on the road.

### Michigan State
* Line: 5
* Prediction: Over
* Wins: Youngstown State, Miami (FL), Nebraska, Western KY, Rutgers, Purdue
* Loses: Northwestern, Indiana, Michigan, OSU, PSU, Maryland
* Notes: I think ~~over 4.5 is great value~~ over 5 is pretty good value; 5-6 wins seems realistic for MSU. There are a lot of question marks with the team, but I think Mel Tucker can get the team to a bowl game. I believe that in true MSU fashion, they're going to win the games they're supposed to lose, and lose the games they should win. Pretty much any of the losses on the schedule could easily be wins, outside of Ohio State. In the same vein, MSU could very easily drop an easy win like Maryland or Nebraska.

### Ohio State
* Line: 11.5
* Prediction: Over
* Wins: All of them
* Loses: Oregon, PSU/Michigan/Indiana (all unlikely)
* Notes: Look, they’re going to win all their games. 12 wins is sooo much more likely than the Buckeyes dropping 2 games. I think that Oregon is the best chance for a loss, but it’s a home game for OSU and the last time they lost at home was to Baker Mayfield. OSU plays Michigan and Indiana away, which could possibly result in a loss, but it’s doubtful.

### Penn State
* Line: 8.5
* Prediction: Over
* Wins: Ball State, Auburn, Villanova, Indiana, Illinois, Maryland, Michigan, Rutgers, MSU
* Loses: Wisconsin, Iowa, OSU
* Notes: I think that PSU ends up right at 9 wins, but it’s more likely that they get 8 wins rather than 10. I’m guessing the Iowa game will be a night game, which PSU traditionally struggles with. I don’t think that PSU will lose to Indiana 2 years in a row. Michigan could be a loss, but it’s most likely going to be a White Out, which is a tough environment to lose in.

### Rutgers
* Line: 4
* Prediction: Over
* Wins: Temple, Syracuse, Delaware, Illinois
* Loses: Michigan, OSU, MSU, Northwestern, Wisconsin, Indiana, PSU, Maryland
* Notes: It looks right now that there are 4 games with a good chance of Rutgers winning. If 2020 is to be believed, Rutgers is trending in the right direction, and I think that they can sneak a win over one of either MSU or Maryland.

## B1G West

I don't care for the West

### Illinois
* Line: 3.5
* Prediction: Over
* Wins: Nebraska, UTSA, Purdue, Charlotte 
* Loses: UVA, Maryland, Wisconsin, PSU, Rutgers, Minnesota, Iowa, Northwestern
* Notes: There’s a bunch of value here. Illinois is going to be bad, but I think that they can easily sneak out of 2021 with a 4-8 or better record. Nebraska could be a loss, as well as Purdue. Maryland and Rutgers both have potential to be wins.

### Iowa
* Line: 8.5
* Prediction: Under
* Wins: Kent State, Colorado State, Maryland, PSU, Purdue, Minnesota, Illinois, Nebraska
* Loses: Indiana, Iowa State, Wisconsin, Northwestern
* Notes: This feels like another great lock (potentially of the century). There’s no way in heck that Iowa has a 9 win this season, even if the season is an easy one. The away schedule is pretty easy, the only real challenge on the road is Iowa State. I have Iowa at 8 wins, but I think they’ll drop one of either PSU or Minnesota to put them at 7-5 for 2021.

### Minnesota
* Line: 7.5
* Prediction: Under
* Wins: Miami OH, Bowling Green, Purdue, Nebraska, Maryland, Illinois
* Loses: OSU, Colorado, Northwestern, Iowa, Indiana, Wisconsin
* Notes: Minnesota is bad, and I will continue to die on this hill. I don’t know why I feel this way, I think I just really don’t like PJ Fleck for some reason. 7 wins really does seem like the right number, but I could see Minnesota dropping the game at Colorado to drop them to 6 wins on the year.

### Nebraska
* Line: 6.5
* Prediction: Under
* Wins: Fordham, Buffalo, Purdue
* Loses: Illinois, Oklahoma, MSU, Northwestern, Michigan, Minnesota, OSU, Wisconsin, Iowa
* Notes: I think that the B1G is still pissed at Nebraska re: 2020, because this schedule is absolute hell. Nebraska plays pretty much every heavy hitter (sans PSU) from both divisions plus out-of-conference Oklahoma. Under 6 games is the official lock of the century. The games are stacked back-to-back with virtually no buffer. If Nebraska gets 5 wins by squeaking by Illinois and MSU/Northwestern, I would consider the season a success.

### Northwestern
* Line: 6.5
* Prediction: Over
* Wins: MSU, Indiana State, Duke, Ohio, Nebraska, Rutgers, Minnesota, Iowa, Purdue, Illinois
* Loses: Michigan, Wisconsin
* Notes: Northwestern has a great schedule, and will easily be able to get to 7 wins. The MSU and Iowa games could be losses, but all of my potential losses (Michigan, Wisconsin) could very easily be wins.

### Purdue
* Line: 5.5
* Prediction: Under
* Wins: Oregon State, Connecticut
* Loses: Notre Dame, Illinois, Minnesota, Iowa, Wisconsin, Nebraska, MSU, OSU, Northwestern, Indiana
* Notes: I don’t know much about Purdue, but I think 4 wins seems more reasonable than 6. I don’t see a lot of wins on the schedule. They could beat Illinois, Nebraska, and _maaaybe_ MSU on the right weekend, but I doubt that all 3 happen, and they stay at 4 wins or less. 

### Wisconsin
* *Line:* 9.5
* *Prediction:* Over
* *Wins:* PSU, Eastern Michigan, Notre Dame, Michigan, Illinois, Army, Purdue, Iowa, Rutgers, Northwestern, Nebraska, Minnesota
* *Loses:* None?!
* *Notes:* Wisconsin could easily lose PSU, ND, Michigan, Army, Iowa, or Northwestern, but all of these are home games and I don’t see them dropping more than 2 of these games, which would still leave them with 10 wins. They have a great schedule this season (no OSU), and I think are going to absolutely slaughter (unless Mertz ends up being horrible, then we’ll have to reevaluate but that’s all the fun).
