# Week 1

## B1G Games

### Illinois @ Virginia
* **Point spread:** `UVA -10 @ -109`
* **Score prediction:** `ILL 17, UVA 28`
* **Status:** ❌
* **Payout:** `-1u`
* I don’t want to support Illinois after UTSA
* I wouldn’t be mad about Illinois winning this one to help out the win total future

### Miami (OH) @ Minnesota
* **Point spread:** `MINN -20.5 @ -108`
* **Score prediction:** `UM 14, MINN 35`
* **Status:** ❌
* **Payout:** `-1u`
* Minnesota, they looked good against OSU
* Line has come down, since they’re missing Ibrahim
  * They’ll still be good against bad competition without Ibrahim

### Youngstown State @ Michigan State
* **Point spread:** `MSU -20.5 @ -108`
* **Score prediction:** `YSU 10, MSU 35`
* **Status:** ❌
* **Payout:** `-1u`
* MSU looked scary competent against Northwestern
* They’ll easily win by 3 possessions, as long as they don’t look ahead to Miami

### Oregon @ Ohio State
* **Point spread:** `UO +14.5 @ -114`
* **Score prediction:** `UO 24, OSU 35`
* **Status:** ❌
* **Payout:** `-1u`
* No Kayvon Thibidoux for Oregon?
  * He’s definitely going to start
* OSU doesn’t lose at home
  * Do I really think it will be that close?
* It seems more like a 2 possession win for OSU
* I would be more comfortable at UO +14.5 or something
  * Right now it’s being offered at UO +14, might wait to see if it goes down?
  * I just took it, frick 'em

### Indiana State @ Northwestern
* **Point spread:** `ISU +26.5 @ -110`
* **Score prediction:** `ISU 14, NW 31`
* **Status:** ❌
* **Payout:** `-1u`
Northwestern can’t score, but will win
ISU can definitely keep it within 4 possessions

### Rutgers @ Syracuse
* **Point spread:** `RUT -1.5 @ -108`
* **Score prediction:** `RUT 31, SYR 14`
* **Status:** ❌
* **Payout:** `-1u`
* Rutgers is going to be tasty to bet on all year
* This game is an absolute lock, Rutgers is seriously improving

### Purdue @ Connecticut
* **Point spread:** `UCONN +33 @ -108`
* **Score prediction:** `PUR 35, UCONN 7`
* **Status:** ❌
* **Payout:** `-1u`
* Purdue is not nearly good enough to win by 4 possessions
* I feel bad about locking this one up early as everyone has said that UConn is overrated, despite being ranked last in the entire NCAA
* I just thought that Purdue wouldn’t be able to score that much
* There’s still hope I guess, with the HC being fired the players might play harder

### Buffalo @ Nebraska
* **Point spread:** `BUF +12 @ -108`
* **Score prediction:** `BUF 17, NEB 28`
* **Status:** ❌
* **Payout:** `-1u`
* Buffalo is a pretty strong MAC team
* They would be looking to make a statement, I think they can keep it close
* Maybe wait and see if the spread goes higher?
* Line has since increased to BUF +13.5
* Upon further review this one feels like a pretty bad beat

### Ball State @ Penn State
* **Point spread:** `BALL +22.5 @ -108`
* **Score prediction:** `BSU 14, PSU 35`
* **Status:** ❌
* **Payout:** `-1u`
* 3 possessions is a reasonable win margin
* Ball State is decent, and PSU was not able to score at all against Wisconsin
* Penn State might also be looking ahead to the Auburn game next week
* I am putting a lot of eggs into the week 1 basket
  * PSUs offense couldn’t get the job done, and I will bet against it until proven wrong

### Iowa @ Iowa State
* **Point spread:** `IOWA +4 @ -104`
* **Score prediction:** `IOWA 20, ISU 17`
* **Status:** ❌
* **Payout:** `-1u`
* Iowa State is too trendy
  * Iowa State always seems to start slow
* ISU playing in black uniforms has just sealed their fate, guaranteed outright loss
* Iowa looked super good in their first week
  * Allegedly, the offense was not good, lots of defensive scoring
* I think that 3.5 is too low
  * I hope people hammer ISU and the point spread increases for Iowa
  * I think that no matter what happens, the game will be decided by 3 or fewer points
* I also predicted that Iowa would start 1-1, so I’m betting against my opening prediction

### Eastern Michigan @ Wisconsin
* **Point spread:** `WISC -24 @ -108`
* **Score prediction:** `EMU 14, WISC 42`
* **Status:** ❌
* **Payout:** `-1u`
* Wisconsin football is designed to beat up teams worse teams
* The game may be close for a little bit, but I think Wisconsin pounds the ball 
* Wisconsin doesn’t need QB play to win by 4 touchdowns against a bad EMU team
* EMU is not a good MAC team
* It feels like a double standard to have faith in the Wisconsin offense but not the PSU offense after their week 1
* I think what will happen is these games will get swapped -- PSU will dominate on offense and Wisconsin will do horrible

### Howard @ Maryland
* **Point spread:** `MD -31 @ -120`
* **Score prediction:** `UH 7, MD 42`
* **Status:** ❌
* **Payout:** `-1u`
* I’ll go out on a limb and take Maryland
* Maryland looked pretty good against a decent WVU 
* Perhaps this is the year of Rutgers and Maryland
* 31 feels insane, what a dumb move

### Idaho @ Indiana
* **Point spread:** `UI +32.5 @ -109`
* **Score prediction:** `UI 14, IND 38`
* **Status:** ❌
* **Payout:** `-1u`
* I think Idaho plus the points, I have no confidence in Indiana scoring
* So many massive point spreads this week
* Money is made betting on bad football, gotta hope Idaho shows up

### Washington @ Michigan
* **Point spread:** `UW +7 @ -110`
* **Score prediction:** `UW 24, MICH 30`
* **Status:** ❌
* **Payout:** `-1u`
* It feels wrong to bet on Michigan
* If you took the name off of Michigan in this matchup, I would take spread no question
* Michigan looked competent on offense, but it was WMU
  * It’s really difficult to know how much stock to put into week 1 games

## Big Games

### Kansas @ Coastal Carolina
* **Point spread:** `KU +26.5 @ -109`
* **Score prediction:** `KU 17, CC 42`
* **Status:** ❌
* **Payout:** `-1u`
* Friday game, have to bet this one
* Probably take Coastal at whatever is offered
  * I did not do this
* Assuming Kansas can score 17 points again, CC would have to score 44
  * I think that Kansas can keep it close(ish)

### Texas @ Arkansas
* **Point spread:** `UT -7 @ -104`
* **Score prediction:** `UT 38, ARK 31`
* **Status:** ❌
* **Payout:** `-1u`
* I feel like Arkansas is a trendy pick
  * I think that the spread will trend down as people pick Arkansas
* Texas looked pretty good against Louisiana
* Texas may be down Bijon Robinson, will have to check

### Pittsburgh @ Tennessee
* **Point spread:** `PITT -3 @ -115`
* **Score prediction:** `PITT 28, TENN 21`
* **Status:** ❌
* **Payout:** `-1u`
* Would be fun to watch Tennessee lose
* I think Pitt is always better than the public thinks
* The line is trending towards Pitt, not good for me

## PAC After Dark

### Utah @ BYU
* **Point spread:** `BYU +7 @ -111`
* **Score prediction:** `UTAH 31, BYU 28`
* **Status:** ❌
* **Payout:** `-1u`
* BYU wasn’t great, but I think that they can definitely keep it close, if not win outright
* I have no idea what to think about Utah, but I think it’s going to be a competitive game
