## B1G Games

### Nebraska @ Illinois
* **Point spread:** `ILL +7 @ -122`
* **Score prediction:** `ILL 28, NEB 24`
* **Status:** ✅
* **Payout:** `+1.8u`

This game is going to be electric in all the wrong ways: ~~It’s not in America~~ it is being played in Champagne, Illinois. One team is under NCAA investigation and being led by a coach on a seat so hot you’d think it belonged to Jimes Frankbaugh. The other team is at peak optimism--a new, incredibly wide, coach with a good track record for building strong, corn-fed football teams.

Illinois is going to outright win this game. You heard it here first. I’m taking them at plus whatever is offered. They’re returning a lot of starters, which may not be great given Illinois production these past few years, but it certainly makes the job of any incumbent coach easier. The Illini are going to be playing harder than ever for Bielema. Brandon Peters is a solid 6th-year QB (until he gets his annual concussion).

On the flip side, Nebraska has lost two players with great potential: Luke McCaffery and Wan’Dale Robinson. They’re going with Adrian Martinez, which, yikes. They’re not going to score. This game is an absolute lock, I predict The Illinois Fighting Illini outright.
