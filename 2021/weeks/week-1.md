Boy howdy, I have nothing to say about this game, other than it’s a must-win for the Scarlet Knights. Rutgers by 2 touchdowns is a scary spread, but consider this: Temple is not favored to beat Rutgers, yes that Rutgers, by 2 touchdowns. Schiano is going to continue to make them better, and that starts by winning the games you’re supposed to win. A big man once said, you make money by betting on bad teams (but not Temple).
