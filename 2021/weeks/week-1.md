# Week 1

## B1G Games

### Temple @ Rutgers
* **Point spread:** `RUT -13 @ -123`
* **Score prediction:** `TMPL 7, RUT 24`
* **Status:** ⛈️
* **Payout:** `0u`

Boy howdy, I have nothing to say about this game, other than it’s a must-win for the Scarlet Knights. Rutgers by 2 touchdowns is a scary spread, but consider this: Temple is not favored to beat Rutgers, yes that Rutgers, by 2 touchdowns. Schiano is going to continue to make them better, and that starts by winning the games you’re supposed to win. A big man once said, you make money by betting on bad teams (but not Temple).

### Ohio State @ Minnesota
* **Point spread:** `OSU -13.5 @ -114`
* **Score prediction:** `OSU 56, MINN 21`
* **Status:** ✅
* **Payout:** `+1.9u`

This game is free money. 

OSU winning by two touchdowns against pretty much anyone besides the three teams in the entire country that have beaten them in recent memory is free money. Despite the fact that Ohio State’s defense in 2020 was not an 11-man version of the Terminator, and  they’ll be breaking in new quarterback CJ Stroud, this game is still free money. Even with the threat of looking forward past Minnesota to the Oregon game next week, this game is still. Absolutely. Free. Money.

On the other sideline, Minnesota is bad. Even at home. I don’t care what anyone else says, they’re bad. They’re going to continue regressing from the team they were in 2019--the season they beat Auburn in the Outback Bowl. That was PJ Fleck’s peak. Minnesota is losing their top receiving target Rashod Bateman to the NFL, and 6th year quarterback Tanner Morgan is substantially worse than people think. I don’t have data to back this up (this is a common trend, if I care enough, I’ll look up his stats and see if they fit my narrative. If they do, I’ll cherry-pick a few and throw them in for flavor). If Morgan was good, he would be playing in the NFL, not playing college football for enough years to receive a doctorate. 

The only thing I can see happening that makes this game seem competitive is if/when OSU does that thing where they play with their food in the first half, score a momentum-shifting touchdown right before the half, then absolutely curb-stomp the ever-living life out of Minnesota in the second half. 

Side note, these are probably my least 2 favorite coaches in the B1G, but P.J. Fleck is infinitely less likable than Ryan Day, somehow. He should quit it with the whole I’m-better-than-you-because-I’m-wearing-a-tie nonsense.

Anyway, this game is over before it starts, bet the farm on OSU covering.

### Michigan State @ Northwestern
* **Point spread:** `MSU +3 @ -104`
* **Score prediction:** `MSU 20, NW 17` or `MSU 17, NW 20`
* **Status:** ✅
* **Payout:** `+2.0u`

There’s a 100% chance that this game is getting settled by 3 or fewer points.That’s just what happens when Northwestern meets Michigan State. And I refuse to acknowledge that change is possible. 

This game will end 20-17. Not sure which team is winning, but that will be the final score. Neither team can score. Neither team has really been able to score football points for pretty much my entire life.

Northwestern is tough on defense, but I think MSU will be able to get some non-offensive scores and keep it close. Who knows what MSUs defense or NWs offense will look like, so I think somewhere in the 17-20 point range is realistic. 

This game is peak B1G and I cannot wait. Plus it’s late on a Friday. If this game was in East Lansing, I would say MSU wins outright, unfortunately, it’s somewhere in the greater Chicagoland area, so homefield won’t make much of a difference. Also, I’m really going to miss Rocky Lombardi’s Draco Malfoy lookin’ ass.


### Western Michigan @ Michigan
* **Point spread:** `WMU +17 @ -111`
* **Score prediction:** `WMU 27, MICH 42`
* **Status:** ❌
* **Payout:** `-1u`

Ugh. I guess we’ll see how this goes. 

I don’t think that I can ever bet on Michigan, as the inevitable disappointment of them losing combined with the disappointment of losing money is too great. Normally, a three touchdown victory against a MAC school would be a reasonable request; however, I can almost guarantee Michigan stumbles out of the gate (at least offensively, probably defensively too) putting on at best a B- performance as they look ahead to Washington. Compound that with the fact that Western Michigan is one of the better teams in the MAC, and the amount of defensive coaching turnover Michigan has, I don’t think that Michigan will be able to cover.

If the prop is available, I would bet that the first touchdown will not be scored by the Michigan offense.
